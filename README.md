# TouchPaint
Bringing the fluidity of finger painting to the browser, this web application only requires a single Leap Motion Controller (https://store-us.leapmotion.com/) to capture and convert your nuanced movements into art.
#### Point fingers at screen and move them
to paint the selected color across the canvas
#### Make a fist and rotate in plane of screen
to choose color from color wheel
#### Place both hands in front of the screen open
to save the image you've created on-site
#### Lower both hands and make fists
to crumple up and delete your mistakes
