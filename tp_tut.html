	<p style="margin: 3px 15px">Begin drawing by pointing at the screen. One or two fingers may be traced at any time. Lift your fingers off the "page" by easing back. Spin through the color wheel by making a fist and rotating your hand. If you like your creation, save it by lifting two hands above the sensor. If you've made a mistake and would like to start from scratch, make two fists above the sensor.</p>
